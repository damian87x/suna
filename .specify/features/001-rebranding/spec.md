## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a product administrator, I want to rebrand the entire application (currently Kortix/Suna) with new brand identity elements, so that I can deploy the platform with custom branding for different clients or white-label deployments.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a configuration file with new brand names and URLs, **When** I run the rebranding script in dry-run mode, **Then** I see a preview of all changes that would be made without modifying any files
2. **Given** new logo and image assets in a directory, **When** I execute the rebranding script, **Then** all original images are backed up and replaced with the new assets
3. **Given** a completed rebranding operation, **When** I review the change report, **Then** I can see a detailed list of all files modified, text replaced, and images updated
4. **Given** a rebranding error or interruption, **When** I check the backup directory, **Then** I can restore all original files from the timestamped backup

### Edge Cases
- What happens when new image assets are missing? System should report missing assets and skip image replacement
- How does system handle files with mixed permissions? Script should report permission errors and continue with accessible files
- What happens with environment variables in production? System should generate migration instructions for environment variables

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept a configuration file specifying new brand name, product name, company name, and URLs
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a dry-run mode to preview all changes before applying them
- **FR-003**: System MUST create timestamped backups of all files before modification
- **FR-004**: System MUST replace text references to "Kortix", "Suna" and related brands across all code files
- **FR-005**: System MUST replace image assets (logos, favicons, marketing materials) with new branded versions
- **FR-006**: System MUST rename files containing brand names in their filename
- **FR-007**: System MUST generate a detailed change report in JSON format
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: case-sensitivity preference - preserve original case or standardize?]
- **FR-009**: System MUST update environment variable names containing brand references
- **FR-010**: System MUST validate new asset files exist before attempting replacement

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **BrandConfiguration**: Represents the new brand identity with names, URLs, and asset locations
- **ChangeReport**: Documents all modifications made during rebranding with file paths and change types
- **BackupManifest**: Tracks backed up files with original paths and backup locations

## Clarifications

### Session 1: Asset Requirements
**Q1**: Should the system automatically generate derivative assets (e.g., different logo sizes) from source images?
**A1**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Auto-generation vs requiring all sizes pre-created]

**Q2**: How should the system handle branded content in documentation files?
**A2**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Update docs automatically or generate a separate docs migration guide]

**Q3**: What validation should be performed on replacement brand names?
**A3**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Character restrictions, length limits, reserved words to avoid]
