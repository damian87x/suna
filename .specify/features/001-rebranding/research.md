# Research: Automated Rebranding System

## Clarification Resolutions

### 1. Asset Generation Strategy
**Question**: Should the system automatically generate derivative assets from source images?

**Decision**: Require all asset sizes to be pre-created

**Rationale**:
- Simpler implementation without image processing dependencies
- Gives designers full control over each asset variant
- Avoids quality loss from automated resizing
- Reduces complexity and potential failure points

**Alternatives Considered**:
- PIL/Pillow for image processing: Adds dependency, quality concerns
- ImageMagick subprocess: Platform-specific, installation required
- Cloud service integration: Overengineering for this use case

### 2. Documentation Content Handling
**Question**: How should the system handle branded content in documentation files?

**Decision**: Include documentation files in standard text replacement

**Rationale**:
- Markdown files are text-based and safe to process
- Most branding in docs is straightforward text replacement
- Consistent with code file handling

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Skip documentation: Would leave inconsistent branding
- Separate docs tool: Unnecessary complexity
- Manual review only: Defeats automation purpose

### 3. Brand Name Validation Rules
**Question**: What validation should be performed on replacement brand names?

**Decision**: Alphanumeric + dash/underscore, 2-50 characters

**Rationale**:
- Covers common naming conventions
- Works in filenames, URLs, and code identifiers
- Prevents empty or excessively long names

**Validation Rules**:
- Allowed characters: a-zA-Z0-9_-
- Length: 2-50 characters
- No leading/trailing special characters
- No reserved words: con, prn, aux, nul, com[1-9], lpt[1-9] (Windows)

## Technical Decisions

### File Processing Strategy
**Decision**: In-memory processing with regex patterns

**Rationale**:
- Fast for typical file sizes (<1MB)
- Atomic file operations (read all, write all)
- Simple rollback on errors

### Backup Implementation
**Decision**: Full file copies in timestamped directories

**Rationale**:
- Simple restoration process
- Clear backup organization
- No complex versioning logic needed

**Directory Structure**:
```
backup_rebrand_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/
├── frontend/
│   └── [preserved directory structure]
├── backend/
│   └── [preserved directory structure]
└── manifest.json
```

### Change Tracking
**Decision**: Structured JSON report with categorized changes

**Report Structure**:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
  "configuration": {...},
  "summary": {
    "total_files": 100,
    "text_changes": 80,
    "image_replacements": 12,
    "file_renames": 8
  },
  "changes": [
    {
      "file": "path/to/file",
      "type": "TEXT|IMAGE|RENAME",
      "details": "specific changes"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Error Handling
**Decision**: Continue on error with detailed reporting

**Approach**:
- Log permission errors but continue
- Skip missing new assets with warning
- Report all errors in final summary
- Non-zero exit code if any errors occurred

## Best Practices Research

### Python CLI Design
- Use argparse for robust argument parsing
- Support both config file and CLI arguments
- Provide helpful --help documentation
- Use logging module for debug output

### File System Safety
- Never modify files in .git directory
- Preserve file permissions and timestamps
- Handle symbolic links appropriately
- Check disk space before backup

### Testing Strategy
- Mock file system operations in tests
- Test with various character encodings
- Verify backup/restore functionality
- Test interruption recovery

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Opportunities
1. **Parallel Processing**: Could use multiprocessing for large codebases
2. **Incremental Mode**: Could track previously processed files
3. **Pattern Caching**: Compile regex patterns once

### Current Scope
For ~100 files, single-threaded processing is sufficient (~5-10 seconds typical)

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation
- Sanitize file paths to prevent directory traversal
- Validate JSON configuration schema
- Check file permissions before modification

### Safe Defaults
- Require explicit confirmation for production environments
- Default to dry-run for destructive operations
- Clear warning messages for irreversible actions
