## Summary
Create an automated rebranding system that replaces all Kortix/Suna branding elements throughout the codebase with configurable new brand identities, including text replacements, image assets, and file renaming, with safety features like dry-run mode and automatic backups.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11
**Primary Dependencies**: pathlib, json, shutil, argparse, re
**Storage**: File system (backup directories and reports)
**Testing**: pytest with file system mocking
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform CLI (Linux/macOS/Windows)
**Project Type**: single (CLI tool)
**Performance Goals**: Process ~1000 files in under 30 seconds
**Constraints**: Must not modify .git directory, preserve file permissions
**Scale/Scope**: ~50-100 files with brand references, ~12 image assets

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Since constitution is a template, applying general best practices:
- [x] Single responsibility: Tool does one thing - rebranding
- [x] Testable design: Dry-run mode, clear inputs/outputs
- [x] Safety first: Backup before modification
- [x] User control: Configuration-driven, preview mode
- [x] Transparency: Detailed reporting

├── test_backup.py       # Backup functionality tests
└── fixtures/            # Test fixtures and mock files
```

**Structure Decision**: Single project - standalone CLI tool

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

### Research Tasks Executed:
1. **Asset generation decision**: Resolved to require pre-created assets (simpler, more control)
2. **Documentation handling**: Include docs in text replacement, separate migration guide for complex changes
3. **Brand name validation**: Allow alphanumeric + dash/underscore, 2-50 chars, no reserved words

### Decisions Made:
1. **Case handling**: Preserve original case patterns (Kortix→NewBrand, kortix→newbrand, KORTIX→NEWBRAND)
2. **File patterns**: Process common code extensions (py, ts, tsx, js, jsx, json, md, yaml, yml, env, html)
3. **Backup strategy**: Timestamp-based directories, full file copies before modification
4. **Report format**: JSON with sections for text changes, image replacements, file renames

**Output**: research.md created with all clarifications resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

### Completed Artifacts:

1. **data-model.md**: Created comprehensive data model with:
   - BrandConfiguration entity with validation rules
   - ChangeReport structure for tracking modifications
   - BackupManifest for restoration capability
   - State transitions for process flow

2. **contracts/cli-interface.yaml**: OpenAPI specification defining:
   - CLI parameter schema
   - Request/response formats
   - Error handling contracts
   - Validation rules

3. **quickstart.md**: User guide with:
   - Step-by-step rebranding process
   - Configuration examples
   - Testing procedures
   - Troubleshooting guide

4. **Contract test requirements** (to be implemented):
   - Test configuration validation
   - Test dry-run mode behavior
   - Test backup creation
   - Test report generation

**Output**: All Phase 1 artifacts created successfully

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
The /tasks command will generate tasks in the following categories:

1. **Setup Tasks** [P - can be done in parallel]:
   - Create test directory structure
   - Set up test fixtures
   - Configure pytest environment

2. **Core Implementation Tasks**:
   - Implement BrandConfiguration class with validation
   - Create Rebrander class with main logic
   - Implement backup functionality
   - Add text replacement logic
   - Add image replacement logic
   - Implement file renaming logic
   - Create report generation

3. **Testing Tasks** (TDD approach):
   - Write tests for configuration validation [P]
   - Write tests for text replacement [P]
   - Write tests for image replacement [P]
   - Write tests for backup/restore [P]
   - Write integration tests

4. **Documentation Tasks**:
   - Update README with usage instructions
   - Add inline documentation
   - Create example configurations

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Tests first (TDD) for each component
- Core classes before features
- Integration after unit components
- Documentation parallel with implementation

**Estimated Output**: 20-25 numbered tasks in tasks.md, with clear dependencies and [P] markers for parallel execution

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Complexity Tracking
*No complexity violations - design follows single-responsibility principle*

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [x] Complexity deviations documented (none required)
